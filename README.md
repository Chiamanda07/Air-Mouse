# Air-Mouse
It is just like your casual computer mouse, except it doesn't actually need a USB cord and is wireless. It's connected to your laptop using Bluetooth and pretends to be a normal mouse using HID (Human Interface Device). It's connected to your laptop using Bluetooth and pretends to be a normal mouse using HID (Human Interface Device). It has 1 button and can be used to scroll.

## TinkerCad
Before fleshing out the circuit, I made a [TinkerCad circuit](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/fCuXMns8fIN-air-mouse-simulation?sharecode=EPAM1r4ufd7JlZj-CBQMTo9suULBRHwCPn_ASLRwwXA). Instead of using and ESP32 for this I used an arduino and instead of a MPU6050(which would contol cursor movement), I used potentiometers.
